- chunked transfer encoding: note: runs until chunk = Empty
- range: in python3 it is a generator, thus more efficient
- sum: dont give sum an integer variable, it could cause problems when working with lists (error: int not callable)
- fromkeys: list(dict.fromkeys(new_menu)) and list(set(old_list))

# September 2
